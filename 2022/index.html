            <h2>Aims and Scope</h2>
            <p>Recent proliferation of scientific papers and technical documents
              has become an obstacle to efficient information acquisition of new
              information in various fields.. It is almost impossible for individual
              researchers to check and read all related documents. Even retrieving
              relevant documents is becoming harder and harder. This workshop
              gathers all the researchers and experts who are aiming at scientific
              document analysis from various perspectives, and invite technical
              paper presentations and system demonstrations that cover any aspects
              of scientific document analysis. </p>

<!-- <h3><b>Title:</b>Towards consent-driven, ethically sound NLP for peer reviews</h3> -->
<!-- <p> -->
<!-- <b>Abstract:</b> Peer review is the major way to determine the status and importance of research outputs in science. The explosive publication growth of the past decades puts a strain on the traditional peer reviewing. Peer reviews are text, and thus make a promising target for natural language processing, from simple reviewer assistance to end-to-end review generation. However, peer reviewing data available for NLP research is scarce: existing datasets come from limited domains and are associated with a range of ethical and privacy-related challenges. What data does a single peer reviewing campaign produce? Who owns this data, and who should have a say in making it public? How can this data be redistributed and built upon? How can a research community transition to semi-open peer review, if decided to do so? -->


<!-- UKP Lab leads the discussion on making data from the ACL community available for peer reviewing research. In this talk, we will discuss the major challenges of peer review as NLP data type, and present our past and ongoing work in analyzing peer reviewing data, providing secure access to sensitive review texts, and building sustainable workflows for continuous peer reviewing data collection. Our efforts contribute to consent-driven, ethically sound NLP for peer reviews in the ACL community and beyond. -->

            <h2>Submissions</h2>
            There are two classes of submissions:
            <ul>
              <li>Long paper on original and completed work, including concrete evaluation and analysis wherever appropriate; and</li>
              <li>Short paper on a small, focused contribution, work in progress, a negative result, or an opinion piece.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> The page limits are up to 14 pages including references for the longer papers, and up to 7 pages including references for the short papers. (Reviewers will be told that there is no penalty for writing a shorter submission.) </p>
            <p> All submissions should be written in English, formatted according to the Springer Verlag LNCS style in a pdf form, which can be obtained from <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">here</a>. <b>The paper should be anonymized.</b> If you use a word file, please follow the instruction of the format, and then convert it into a pdf form and submit it at the paper submission page. </p>
            <p> For both classes, in addition to the original unpublished work, we also accept the papers that have already been published or presented in other venues. This submission should also be anonymized, and will be reviewed by the program committee. </p>
            <p> The accepted papers will <b>not</b> be archived in general.
              The papers are distributed to the participants of the workshop on a USB flash drive. If the authors hope to make their paper publicly available, we also will provide a link to the pdf on this webpage. Otherwise, we do not upload the papers on the web.
              Unpublished submissions on both long and short paper tracks are considered as the candidates for post-proceedings of LNAI (the authors can also reject the invitation, if they wish). The papers will be archived only by this post-proceedings. </p>
            <p> You can submit your paper at <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scidoca2022"> https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scidoca2022 </a>.
              If you cannot submit a paper by EasyChair System by some trouble,
              please send email to "nguyenml[at]jaist.ac.jp" </p>
            <p> <b> If a paper is accepted, at least one author of the paper must register
