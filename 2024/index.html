              <h2>Aims and Scope</h2>
              <p>Recent proliferation of scientific papers and technical documents
                has become an obstacle to efficient information acquisition of new
                information in various fields. It is almost impossible for individual
                researchers to check and read all related documents. Even retrieving
                relevant documents is becoming harder and harder. This workshop
                gathers all the researchers and experts who are aiming at scientific
                document analysis from various perspectives, and invite technical
                paper presentations and system demonstrations that cover any aspects
                of scientific document analysis. </p>

                    <span style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 20px;"><b>Abstract: </b> The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) based AI systems has been disruptive to many sectors of our lives, and soon they will act as autonomous agents on our behalf in dealing with complex real-world problems while interacting with other agents and humans. However, it is unclear that when multiple of these LLM agents interact with each other, how they would influence each other’s behaviour. This is especially true if they are programmed to be strategic (i.e., selfish, or malicious) on the behalf of their human owners/creators. These strategic behaviours, if not mitigated efficiently, will cause societal, financial, ethical, and safety disasters. In this talk, I will discuss a number of key research challenges and problems that need to be addressed to avoid such disasters. These include: (i) last round/last iterate convergence in non-cooperative multi-agent learning; (ii) efficient learning with limited verifications against strategic manipulators; and (iii) truthful machine learning. While it is still unknown how these challenges should be addressed in the multi-LLM-agent setting, I will demonstrate how this has been addressed within the multiagent research community for simpler agent models, drawing some intuitions for future work on LLM agents. </span> <br><br>

                    <span style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 20px;"><b>Abstract: </b> I had been involved as a co-researcher in the JST・CREST project "Knowledge discovery from large-scale literature information based on structural understanding" under the leadership of Prof. Yuji Matsumoto. Therein, our particular focus was  on "Knowledge discovery based on the structural relationships of large-scale citation networks and literature texts." In this talk, I will present the latest research outcomes in several ongoing follow-up projects related to large-scale literature data analysis. Specifically, in the current JST・CREST project "Human Computation foundations for collaboration between humans and AI," we are currently working on supporting scientific activities based on literature data analysis. Additionally, in the NEDO project "Forecasting scientific and technological trends based on the fusion of pre-trained Language models and network models," we are also working on predicting the impact of scientific research using large-scale literature data aiming at supporting science and technology policy making. Lastly, in our university's collaborative project with the industry "Technology Informatics," we are working on knowledge extraction from literature data to support R&amp;D activities. Through these our recent researches and their findings, I would like to share insights particularly on the foundational techniques and applications of large-scale literature data analysis based on network analysis approaches. </span> <br><br>

            <!-- <p> -->
            <!-- <b>Abstract:</b> Peer review is the major way to determine the status and importance of research outputs in science. The explosive publication growth of the past decades puts a strain on the traditional peer reviewing. Peer reviews are text, and thus make a promising target for natural language processing, from simple reviewer assistance to end-to-end review generation. However, peer reviewing data available for NLP research is scarce: existing datasets come from limited domains and are associated with a range of ethical and privacy-related challenges. What data does a single peer reviewing campaign produce? Who owns this data, and who should have a say in making it public? How can this data be redistributed and built upon? How can a research community transition to semi-open peer review, if decided to do so? -->


            <!-- UKP Lab leads the discussion on making data from the ACL community available for peer reviewing research. In this talk, we will discuss the major challenges of peer review as NLP data type, and present our past and ongoing work in analyzing peer reviewing data, providing secure access to sensitive review texts, and building sustainable workflows for continuous peer reviewing data collection. Our efforts contribute to consent-driven, ethically sound NLP for peer reviews in the ACL community and beyond. -->
