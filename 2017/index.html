            <h2>Aims and Scope</h2>
            <p>Recent proliferation of scientific papers and technical documents
              has become an obstacle to efficient information acquisition of new
              information in various fields.. It is almost impossible for individual
              researchers to check and read all related documents. Even retrieving
              relevant documents is becoming harder and harder. This workshop
              gathers all the researchers and experts who are aiming at scientific
              document analysis from various perspectives, and invite technical
              paper presentations and system demonstrations that cover any aspects
              of scientific document analysis. </p>

            <p> For both classes, in addition to the original unpublished work, we also accept the papers that have already been published or presented in other venues. This submission should also be anonymized, and will be reviewed by the program committee. </p>
            <p> The accepted papers will <b>not</b> be archived in general.
              The papers are distributed to the participants of the workshop on a USB flash drive. If the authors hope to make their paper publicly available, we also will provide a link to the pdf on this webpage. Otherwise, we do not upload the papers on the web.
              Unpublished submissions on both long and short paper tracks are considered as the candidates for post-proceedings of LNAI (the authors can also reject the invitation, if they wish). The papers will be archived only by this post-proceedings. </p>

                  Title: Do Future Work sections have a purpose? (and other global scientometric questions) </h2>
                <em> Abstract: How should the community of scientific text processing set its sights (and goals) for the near future? One possibility is to look at global scientometric questions; questions that historians of science ask, such as: What are the most contested ideas in a particular research area at this moment? Which new ideas emerged in the past 5 years in that area? Maybe we could even ask where the most innovative research happens at the moment. At first, such questions might seem unanswerable and vague, but  given a large text base, I believe that it is possible to answer important aspects of these questions objectively and quantifiably. In doing so, we won't be able to ignore entailment and inference in scientific writing. This is hard, but exciting; and recent developments in NLP, such as better parsing and more robust entailment, should help us some of the way here. <br>
                As a test case and thought experiment, I will ask the question of which purpose, if any, future work sections fulfill in a scientific paper. </em> </li>

                    Title: Toward Linked and Shared Resources of Scientific Literature Annotation </h2>
                  <em> Abstract: As efficient access to the content of scientific literature is more
                  and more desired, annotation to scientific literature is more and more
                  recognized as an important resource,
                  and there are now a number of large projects to develop annotations to
                  large bodies of scientific literature, e.g. the whole PubMed or PubMed
                  Central. While the community of text mining has invested a lot for the
                  productivity of literature annotation, there is also a growing
                  interest in exchange and storage for literature annotation. The talk
                  will begin with an introduction to various efforts for scientific
                  literature annotation, and discuss issues for shared scientific
                  literature annotation, from three different aspects: productivity,
                  interoperability, and accessibility. </em> </li>

                    Title:What is required to develop scalable semantics? </h2>
                  <em> Abstract: The long term promise of Newell and Simon’s physical symbol systems hypothesis has historically relied on many decades of research on formalizing semantics in a manner that provided the basis for mechanical extraction and processing of semantic content. The application of this hypothesis has exploited a variety of semantical theories, from the earliest accounts of denotational semantics of formal philosophers and logicians like Frege, to the sophisticated representations of natural language in higher order intensional logics, like Montague, to the rapid proliferation of technologies like the resource description framework (RDF) as the basis for metadata components underlying the semantic web. <br />
                  The current era of “big data” has created the challenge of being more deliberate about the development and deployment of technologies and methods to create semantics carrying content, especially when considering applications like general question answering, literature-based discovery, and general knowledge curation. A central focus of research on big data and natural language information extraction covers a broad spec-trum of research methodologies, including the spectrum from fix-relation extraction to open relation extraction, deep parsing versus information retrieval-based question answering, and shallow versus deep formal representations of language to support reasoning and inference. <br />
                  The idea of scalable semantics is to develop a kind of semantic data stack that can provide guidance in the development and deployment of semantic information extraction, appropriate to application goals, for example in the spectrum of sentiment analysis of Tweets all the way to deep question answering on full texts. <br />
                  Here we present some of the challenges of the development of such a scalable semantics stack, by providing examples of both boundaries between layers, and the kind of integration of multiple levels that will be required for multi-scale semantics. </em></li>
