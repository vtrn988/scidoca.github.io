              <h2>Aims and Scope</h2>
              <p>Recent proliferation of scientific papers and technical documents
                has become an obstacle to efficient information acquisition of new
                information in various fields. It is almost impossible for individual
                researchers to check and read all related documents. Even retrieving
                relevant documents is becoming harder and harder. This workshop
                gathers all the researchers and experts who are aiming at scientific
                document analysis from various perspectives, and invite technical
                paper presentations and system demonstrations that cover any aspects
                of scientific document analysis. </p>

                    <span style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 20px;"><b>Abstract:</b>
                      While large language models (LLMs) have been pushing the state-of-the-art in a variety of
                      Natural
                      Language Processing tasks, they have an important drawback, which is the difficulty in
                      interpreting their internal representations and controlling them. This fact raises practical and
                      ethical concerns about their use. To alleviate this problem, we propose a method for
                      incorporating
                      information about the role of each word in a dictionary definition towards the meaning of the
                      defined term. This promotes disentanglement of said roles in the internal representations of the
                      models, allowing better interpretation of their properties and a higher degree of control over
                      the
                      generated text. </span><br>

                        Recent advantages of the LLMs (Large Language Models, such as ChatGPT) affect not only to the
                        NLP community but the global society of the oridinary people.
                        A question is that the LLMs could solve what sort of NLP problems, though it is still under
                        investigation. Another question is that to what extent the LLMs are "similar" to the humans --
                        they apparently differ in its architecture and the training data size.
                        I introduce a couple of related NLP projects that I organize, such as automatic medical
                        diagnosis, AIWolf project (dialog system in conversation games), Legal NLP (legal bar exam
                        solver), and SNS analysis project for public opinions, discuss the ability and limitations of
                        the LLMs with future directions.</span><br>

                      The rapid development of recent language models has greatly improved the
                      performance of various natural language processing tasks such as
                      information extraction, summarization, or question answering.
                      This talk will present some of the recent techniques in various areas of
                      scientific text analysis to explore the challenges and future perspectives.</span> <br>

            <!-- <p> -->
            <!-- <b>Abstract:</b> Peer review is the major way to determine the status and importance of research outputs in science. The explosive publication growth of the past decades puts a strain on the traditional peer reviewing. Peer reviews are text, and thus make a promising target for natural language processing, from simple reviewer assistance to end-to-end review generation. However, peer reviewing data available for NLP research is scarce: existing datasets come from limited domains and are associated with a range of ethical and privacy-related challenges. What data does a single peer reviewing campaign produce? Who owns this data, and who should have a say in making it public? How can this data be redistributed and built upon? How can a research community transition to semi-open peer review, if decided to do so? -->


            <!-- UKP Lab leads the discussion on making data from the ACL community available for peer reviewing research. In this talk, we will discuss the major challenges of peer review as NLP data type, and present our past and ongoing work in analyzing peer reviewing data, providing secure access to sensitive review texts, and building sustainable workflows for continuous peer reviewing data collection. Our efforts contribute to consent-driven, ethically sound NLP for peer reviews in the ACL community and beyond. -->

                  appropriate; and</li>

                including references for the short papers. (Reviewers will be told that there is no penalty for writing
                a shorter submission.) </p>
              <p> All submissions should be written in English, formatted according to the Springer Verlag LNCS style in
                a pdf form, which can be obtained from <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">here</a>. <b>The paper should be
                  anonymized.</b> If you use a word file, please follow the instruction of the format, and then convert
                it into a pdf form and submit it at the paper submission page. </p>
              <p> For both classes, in addition to the original unpublished work, we also accept the papers that have
                already been published or presented in other venues. This submission should also be anonymized, and will
                be reviewed by the program committee. </p>
              <p> The accepted papers will <b>not</b> be archived in general.
                The papers are distributed to the participants of the workshop on a USB flash drive. If the authors hope
                to make their paper publicly available, we also will provide a link to the pdf on this webpage.
                Otherwise, we do not upload the papers on the web.
                Unpublished submissions on both long and short paper tracks are considered as the candidates for
                post-proceedings of LNAI (the authors can also reject the invitation, if they wish). The papers will be
                archived only by this post-proceedings. </p>
